Geo ip for Yii2

Sypex Geo is an IP location based product from the creators of Sypex Dumper. Having received the IP-address, Sypex Geo gives out information about the visitor's location - country, region, city, geographic coordinates.

Sypex Geo - distributed under the BSD license, that is, it is completely free.

As a database, Sypex Geo uses a binary file of its own format. This format is open and universal. When developing the format, a lot of work was done to optimize the algorithm. Due to this, Sypex Geo works much faster than competitors, consumes less memory, and also produces fewer disk accesses (due to which, on busy servers, the difference is even greater in favor of Sypex Geo).
